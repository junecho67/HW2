        <h3>1. Sign Up & Create a Profile</h3>
        <p>
            Users start by signing up for PawPal with a simple registration process. You will provide basic information, including your name, email, and location.
            Next, you will create a profile for yourself and your dog. This includes important details such as your dogs breed, age, temperament, and walking preferences (distance, pace, time of day).
        </p>

        <h3>2. Set Your Preferences</h3>
        <p>
            You can set preferences for what kind of walking partner you are looking for. For instance, you might want a walking buddy with a dog of similar size, or you may prefer walks at a certain time of day or in a specific neighborhood.
            You can also decide whether you want to join group walks or meet with one person at a time.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Match with Dog Owners</h3>
        <p>
            PawPal uses a matching system similar to apps like Tinder. You will be shown nearby dog owners who fit your preferences, and you can swipe right if you're interested or left if not.
            If both parties swipe right, it is a match! You will be able to message the other dog owner to plan your walk.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Plan & Schedule Walks</h3>
        <p>
            Once you have matched, you can schedule a walk at a time that works for both you and your new walking buddy. PawPal offers a built-in calendar to help plan these walks.
            The app can suggest popular walking routes in your area, or you can choose your favorite park or path.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Track Your Walks</h3>
        <p>
            When you're on your walk, you can use the PawPal GPS tracking feature to record your route. You can also save and share your favorite walking paths with others.
            The tracking ensures that your walks are not only fun but also keep your dog healthy by tracking the distance and time walked.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Review and Rate</h3>
        <p>
            After a walk, you can rate your walking partner and provide feedback. This helps the community stay safe and find reliable walking partners.
            You can also mark certain users as ‚Äúfavorites‚Äù to easily schedule future walks with them.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Join Group Walks or Events</h3>
        <p>
            PawPal also hosts group walks and dog-friendly events where you can meet more local dog owners. You can check the event calendar for upcoming group activities in your area.
        </p>
